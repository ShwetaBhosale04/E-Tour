E-Tour is a web-based application for online booking of various tours. The main objective of the project is to create a fast, effective &
 reliable online working platform to develop a communication system between customers & the agency. We have implemented
 authentication & authorization so that only authorized users will be able to register, login and book a tour. Also, users can search for a
 particular tour based on duration, cost and date, and on successful booking, a bill will be generated
