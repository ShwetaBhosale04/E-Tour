									<th scope="row">
										<b>Why is Travelguru using Metasearch technology now?</b>
										<p align="justify">
											The airline industry is in a state of change. Airlines now have introduced “web fares” – a web fare is a fare that an airline sells on its website which is much lower than what is sells through travel agents. With the increased rollout of web fares by airlines, we realized that customers who booked through travel agents – whether online or offline – were paying more than if they booked on the airline website direct. Hence we decided, in the interest of our customers, to use metasearch technology to ensure that they can book web fares on the airline website direct, hence saving costs.</p>
